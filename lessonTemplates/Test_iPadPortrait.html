Although the United States is known for celebrating freedom, human rights, and diversity, those essential values have been challenged in times of crisis.  Even before the Second World War, immigrants from China and Japan faced discrimination in the U.S. When Pearl Harbor was bombed in December of 1941, the situation got much worse.

For this project, you will begin with several group activities to help you and your peers become familiar with this time period. What was it like for a Japanese American during World War II?
