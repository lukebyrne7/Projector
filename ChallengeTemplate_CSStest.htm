<p>The only thing more important to our survival than air is water, and not everyone has enough of it. This challenge gives you a chance to work on solutions to this problem.</p>
<p>The Chairperson for the South Carolina State Climatology Office recently reported, &quot;Three years of inadequate rainfall have resulted in low stream flow, lake levels, and water tables. The supply of water isn’t keeping up with demand, and the problem isn’t going away.&quot; &quot;In fact,&quot; she continued, &quot;the state may face another five to 10 years of below-average rainfall, so it’s increasingly important to find ways to conserve water. That's why we've created the South Carolina Water Conservation Committee and given it the goal of finding ways to reduce water waste in our state.&quot; The drought problem goes way beyond South Carolina. Here in the U.S., one in three states are either experiencing drought already or are at high risk for water shortages. Water tables are nature's reservoirs, and like some U.S. states, many developing nations around the world are using water at a rate that is lowering their water tables. Simply put, people are using water faster than nature can replace it. To help protect the future of the planet, we need to get on top of this problem now. Finding solutions to the problem will mean digging in to figure out where the water's going and what people are already doing to try to stop wasting it. It'll mean thinking up new ways to do things and figuring out how to put together a solution that can work in your community and even around the world. And it'll mean convincing the people who can put your solution to work that yours is the right one to use.  The South Carolina Water Conservation Committee is providing a $500,000 small business start-up grant to the individuals who develop and propose an innovative, cost-effective, and feasible solution to increase water conservation. You and a group of your friends have decided to apply for the grant. You’ll develop a solution using the design process discussed in class. Your proposal will include documentation of each step of the design process, a design brief, decision matrix, a model or prototype of your solution, and a final proposal to be presented to the grant review committee.</p>
